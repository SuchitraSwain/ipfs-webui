# 🚀 Enhance CI/CD Pipeline and GitHub Format Checks

## 📋 Summary

This issue proposes comprehensive improvements to the existing CI/CD pipeline and implementation of robust GitHub format checks to enhance code quality, security, and development workflow efficiency.

## 🎯 Current State Analysis

The project already has a solid CI/CD foundation with:
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows for build, test, lint, typecheck
- ✅ E2E testing with Playwright
- ✅ Unit testing with Jest and coverage reporting
- ✅ ESLint and TypeScript checking
- ✅ Dependency checking with aegir
- ✅ Semantic release automation
- ✅ IPFS deployment and pinning

## 🚀 Proposed Improvements

### 4. **Testing Improvements**

#### 4.1 Test Coverage
- [ ] Set minimum coverage thresholds
- [ ] Add coverage reporting to PR comments

- [ ] Add mutation testing for critical paths

#### 4.2 Test Performance
- [ ] Optimize E2E test execution time
- [ ] Add test result caching
- [ ] Implement flaky test detection and reporting
- [ ] Add performance testing for critical user flows

### 5. **GitHub Workflow Enhancements**

#### 5.1 PR Quality Gates
- [ ] Add required status checks for all PRs
- [ ] Implement branch protection rules
- [ ] Add PR template with checklist
- [ ] Create automated PR labeling system

#### 5.2 Issue and PR Management
- [ ] Add issue templates for different types
- [ ] Implement automated issue labeling
- [ ] Add stale issue/PR management
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines

### 6. **Documentation and Standards**

#### 6.1 Development Standards
- [ ] Create comprehensive contributing guidelines
- [ ] Add code style guide documentation
- [ ] Implement commit message standards (Conventional Commits)
- [ ] Add API documentation standards

#### 6.2 CI/CD Documentation
- [ ] Document all CI/CD workflows
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Add local development setup instructions
- [ ] Document deployment procedures

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Set up Prettier and enhanced ESLint
2. Add security scanning tools
3. Implement basic code quality gates

### Phase 2: Testing & Performance (Week 3-4)
1. Optimize test execution
2. Add bundle analysis
3. Implement coverage thresholds

### Phase 3: Automation & Monitoring (Week 5-6)
1. Add automated PR management
2. Implement monitoring and alerts
3. Create comprehensive documentation

## 📊 Success Metrics

- [ ] **Code Quality**: Maintain >90% test coverage, <5% code duplication
- [ ] **Security**: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities, automated dependency updates
- [ ] **Performance**: <10min CI execution time, <5% bundle size regression
- [ ] **Developer Experience**: <2min feedback time for basic checks

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### New Dependencies
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "prettier": "^3.0.0",
    "eslint-plugin-security": "^1.7.0",
    "husky": "^8.0.0",
    "lint-staged": "^13.0.0",
    "@commitlint/cli": "^17.0.0",
    "@commitlint/config-conventional": "^17.0.0"
  }
}
```

### New GitHub Actions
- `prettier-check.yml` - Code formatting validation
- `security-scan.yml` - Security vulnerability scanning
- `bundle-analysis.yml` - Bundle size monitoring

- `.commitlintrc.js` - Commit message linting
- `.husky/` - Git hooks
- `sonar-project.properties` - SonarCloud configuration

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All code passes Prettier formatting checks
- [ ] Security scans show no high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Bundle size remains within defined limits
- [ ] CI execution time is optimized and monitored
- [ ] PR quality gates prevent low-quality code from merging
